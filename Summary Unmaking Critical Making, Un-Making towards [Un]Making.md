# Critical Making, Un-Making towards [Un]Making 
[talk video link](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=unmaking+research)



## Core Concept: [Un]Making

- **New productivity argument**: The more one avoids production, the more productive they are.
- **Contrasts with**: 20th-century time-and-motion studies, where more production = more productivity.
- **Environmental crisis response**: Avoiding production during limited timeframes should now count as productivity.
- **Key requirement**: Requires creativity in avoiding production (not the same as passive inaction).
- **Alternative to**: Recycling, reuse, or upcycling — this is a deeper refusal to produce.

## Historical Timeline of Making Movements

- **2005**: Start of the maker movement.
- **2011**: Matt Ratto introduces *critical making* — thinking through making, not just making for its own sake.
- **2019**: End of maker movement (Maker Media declared bankruptcy).
- **2020**: *Un-making* emerges as a standalone concept, moving beyond “making and unmaking.”
- **Un-making traits**: Emphasizes degrowth, anti-capitalist attitudes — especially within HCI.

## Representative Objects by Movement

### Maker Movement

- **Mind Over Melon (2012)**: Force-concentration device to explode watermelons.
- **10¢ Stomp Rocket**: Instant rocket launcher from drink packaging.
- **Eco Gym**: Gym equipment made from discarded wood in rural Spain.
- **Dirty Car Art**: Art created on extremely dirty car exteriors.
- **Super Green House**: Greenhouse built entirely from plastic bottles.
- **Paper Hardware**: Non-functional electronics crafted from paper.
- **Shelter from Bus**: Bus stop constructed from a decommissioned bus.
- **Stone Age Telegraph**: Telegraph built using only materials found in the forest.

### Critical Making

- **Huggable Atomic Mushroom**: A bomb you can hug — critiques militarism.
- **Hazmat Kite**: Toxic-warning kite flown in polluted zones.
- **First Chinese Hackerspace**: Necessity-driven creation mixed with counter-cultural ideals.
- **Contingency-Based Artworks**: Art guided by flow and unpredictability, not planning.

### Un-Making

- **Unmaking Electronic Waste (2024)**: Multiple methods of rethinking e-waste streams.
- **Remake to Unmake to Remake**: Systems for recyclable and rebuildable 3D printing.
- **Unmaking Data Imaginaries**: Science fiction writers exploring non-normative data expression.

## Theoretical Foundation

- **1990s deep ecology**: “The only green product is the one that is not produced.”
- **Research aim**: Create real value *without* producing physical objects or fleeing to virtuality.
- **Unmade objects**: Non-produced, technically unrealized items with the highest potential value.

## Japanese Philosophy: "When the Wind Blows, the Barrel Maker Prospers"

- **Traditional chain reaction**:  
  Wind → sand in eyes → blindness → shamisen players → cats killed for shamisen skins → more rats → damaged barrels → barrel makers profit.
- **Un-making interpretation**:
  - Trigger chain reactions indirectly rather than producing directly.
  - Let systems and supply chains *form around* you.
  - Avoid byproducts and externalities by not producing in the first place.

## Bureaucratic Hack Example

- **85% Rule**: EU wine regulation allows 85% of grapes from one region, 15% from elsewhere.
- **Un-making twist**: If only 15% of something is made *somewhere*, you can claim it’s made *nowhere*.
- **Implication**: Stay within “non-production thresholds” for legal/ethical loopholes.

## Key Questions Addressed

- **Material vs. immaterial**: Focus is on material production, but services and intangible values are in scope.
- **Efficiency trade-offs**: Natural emergence is ecologically preferable to industrial efficiency.
- **Value creation**: Value lies in avoiding production chains entirely.
- **Relation to existing practices**: Reframes survival practices of marginalized groups as high-value strategies.
- **Creative destruction vs. reduction**: Advocates for **85% reduction**, not total erasure.
- **Habit disruption**: Interrupts habitual production behaviors.
- **Business applications**: Encourages deeper shifts beyond greenwashing or symbolic sustainability.
