# Unmaking as Emancipation: Lessons from Luddism in HCI

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Smf6NCzkcKs&t=68s) talks about is about **unmaking** as a tactic for **emancipation** in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).

## Why Unmaking?

- HCI claims to care about **social justice**—that means attending to how people experience **oppression** and **marginalization**.
- Most justice-oriented work in HCI is **constructive**—we make things: research tools, prototypes, infrastructures, policies.
- But not all justice work is about making. Sometimes, real change requires **undoing**, **refusing**, **dismantling**, or **breaking** existing systems.
- This is what we call **unmaking**: action through **taking apart**, **taking away**, or **taking down** what already exists.

## Where is Unmaking in HCI?

- Unmaking is gaining attention in HCI:
  - **Dissolving systems** and **collapsing infrastructures**.
  - Removing **emotional**, **ecological**, or **mental harms** caused by design.
  - Using **speculative design** to challenge things like **gentrification**.
- However, many of these works don't **explicitly** frame unmaking as **emancipation**.
- So the core question we ask is:  
  > **If HCI is committed to social justice, and unmaking is part of how emancipation happens, what does HCI need to understand about unmaking?**

## A Historical Case: Luddism

To explore this, we turned to a historical movement: **Luddism**.

### Who Were the Luddites?

- Early 19th-century textile workers in England.
- Faced rising **mechanization** that:
  - Lowered wages,
  - Replaced skilled labor,
  - Produced inferior products.
- Their petitions to regulate machines failed.
- In 1811, they began **smashing machines**.

### What Did They Do?

- Organized under the mythical **Ned Ludd**.
- Used both **material** and **symbolic tactics**:
  - **Targeted machine breaking** (not all tech—only harmful ones),
  - **Songs**, **chants**, **manifestos**, **letters**,
  - Built **community solidarity** and a **shared culture** of resistance.

### What Made Their Unmaking Distinct?

- **Selective**: Only destroyed machines that:
  - Reduced pay,
  - Increased control/surveillance,
  - Fragmented skilled labor.
- **Community-Engaged**: Used secret oaths, cross-occupation organizing, and shared rituals.
- **Emancipatory**: Acted both materially and rhetorically to challenge commercialization and domination.
- **Antagonistic**: Their acts caused real **capital loss** and triggered major state retaliation.
- **Enduring**: Despite suppression, Luddism shaped future critiques of technology.

## Why This Matters to HCI

Luddism shows us forms of unmaking that HCI doesn’t fully engage with:

- **Antagonism**: Luddites didn’t play nice—they went up against real systems of power.
- **Endurance**: Their actions and stories lasted far beyond the immediate movement.
- **No Need to Rebuild**: Their goal wasn’t to replace what they broke—it was to stop the harm.
- **Situated Collective Practice**: Unmaking was shared, performative, and organized.
- **Ethical Edge**: They turned to destruction only after exhausting nonviolent means.

## Critical Questions for HCI

- What are the **limits of constructive making** in the face of structural harm?
- What if building or repairing **isn’t enough**?
- Who gets hurt—or resists—when we try to **unmake** systems of harm?
- What kind of **ethics of unmaking** do we need, especially when **conflict is inevitable**?

> We’re not calling for destruction.  
> We’re calling for a deeper understanding of when **undoing** is necessary.  
> Sometimes, **making is not the path to liberation**.
