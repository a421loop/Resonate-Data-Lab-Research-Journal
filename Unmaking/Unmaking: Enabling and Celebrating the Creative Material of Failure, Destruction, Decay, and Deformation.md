# Unmaking: Enabling and Celebrating the Creative Material of Failure, Destruction, Decay, and Deformation
[paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445529)
## Historical Context

- Gustav Metzger founded the **Auto-Destructive Art** movement in the 1960s as a reaction to World War II violence and destruction.
- Auto-Destructive Art aimed to provoke controversy and bring **destruction into public consciousness**.
- Artists and spectators formed **intimate relationships with the temporality** of artworks.
- Works used dramatic materials and processes: **acid, fire, machines**.
- Metzger called on **scientists and engineers** to collaborate with artists, recognizing the limitations of time and materials.

## Current State of Digital Fabrication

- The field has been heavily focused on **making**, not unmaking.
- Standard 3D modeling software includes operations like: `extrude`, `loft`, `revolve`.
- **3D printers** and modeling tools make fabrication easy and accessible.
- The process is typically seen as **complete after printing**, with little attention to post-production change.

## Unmaking Proposal

- **Unmaking**: the processes of **destruction and decay** that occur *after* an object is made.
- These should be **considered part of the creative process**, not its opposite.
- Requires:
  - New **fabrication strategies**
  - New **software tools**
  - New **materials**
- Calls for a **new set of operations** to support creative practitioners.

## Expanded Design Vocabulary
- Proposed operations for unmaking:
  - `split`, `bulge`, `sag`, `lean`, `shrink`, `dissolve`, `pit`, `shed`
- Goes beyond traditional **additive manufacturing** terms.

## Example Workflow: Splitting and Bulging

1. **3D print** an object using conventional PLA plastic.
2. Embed **hidden chambers** filled with an "active" material.
3. Use **thermally-expanding microspheres (TEMs)** — balloon-like particles that swell with heat.
4. By adjusting **heating temperature and duration**, designers can **control how and when the object unmakes**.

## Software Tool Development

- Developed a tool integrated into standard **CAD modeling software**.
- Enables users to **design and visualize** unmaking effects like bulging or splitting.
- Automatically generates **meshes** for export to slicing software.
- Converts designs to **machine-readable gcode** for 3D printing.

## Material Preparation and Printing Process

- **TEMs** are provided as a powder and mixed with water to create a **slurry**.
- Loaded into a **dual-extruder 3D printer** alongside PLA filament.
- Object appears **normal after printing**.
- Upon **heating**, object deforms — splits or bulges — as designed.
- Produces **unique, unmade artifacts** with expressive physical qualities.

## Advanced Possibilities

- Combine diverse materials and fabrication techniques.
- Embed **hidden, reactive chambers** that interact post-print.
- Trigger unmaking based on how the object is **handled, stored, or activated**.
- Enable **new aesthetic expressions** and **interactive experiences** with digital fabrication.

## Sustainability Applications

- **Split multicolored objects** for easier material separation and recycling.
- Divide printed artifacts into **reusable subcomponents**.
- Turn opaque systems like composting and recycling into **transparent, expressive design spaces**.
- Makes sustainability **engaging and visible** to both makers and observers.

## Future Vision

- As interest in unmaking grows, it will drive:
  - Development of **optimized materials**,
  - **Biodegradable and compostable** components usable in domestic contexts.
- Reduces need for **industrial waste processing**.
- **Reframes waste** as a **creative opportunity** — not just a problem.
