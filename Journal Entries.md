**Reflections From the Walk: Recording on the Zoom Handy Recorder**
- **Recorder In Hand** : Its really strange walking around with a recorder, its like a statement to people around you that are you witnessing to immortalise their every move.
- **Recorder in Pocket**: It feels like I am intruding on anyone who decides to talk to me. It was hard turning it off before someone talks and then I had to delete the whole recording. But personally, I feel safer having it in my pocket that outside.

**Switch To Markdown** 
- I have been wanting to get faster at md and I figured its best to switch to it. This way, I'll get more github practice and write my documentation in a consistent format.

#### Sketching Day 2: 
1. Somantic Scout(need a better name): I've noticed that when I go on walks with the goal to listen, my default shifts from being anxious about the newness to being curious.

## READINGS/LISTENINGS

### [Podcast about Sonic Walks] (https://walkinglab.org/podcast/sound-walks-and-sonic-walks/]

Quotes that stand out 
- "Walking and sound have increasingly been combined in order to explore the sonic ecologies of place. The term soundwalk was first used by Murray Schafer in Vancouver, Canada in the 1970s to describe a method of identifying and describing the soundscapes of a particular environment. Schafer defined a soundscape as the acoustic features that make up a place."
- "Researchers are interested in soundwalks for the ability to immerse walkers in a bodily sense of place."

This made me reflect about my about how I feel so so much in my body when I am on a soundwalk vs a real walk. *I think it has helped me be more curious than anxouus when exploring new places.*

**Reflection on RetroSound Format: Webm Vs MP3**
- I am not sure which one to choose. I was going with webm before first before mp3 wasnt working for me, but then because I found out it has better compression in terms and better quality but it doesnt play on all devices. I think *universal compatibility is a priority* so I need to figure out how to implement MP3. From what i looked up, I will need to use a library (lamejs) that I havent used before. This should be interesting.
