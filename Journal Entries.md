**Reflections From the Walk: Recording on the Zoom Handy Recorder**
- **Recorder In Hand** : Its really strange walking around with a recorder, its like a statement to people around you that are you witnessing to immortalise their every move.
- **Recorder in Pocket**: It feels like I am intruding on anyone who decides to talk to me. It was hard turning it off before someone talks and then I had to delete the whole recording. But personally, I feel safer having it in my pocket that outside.

**Switch To Markdown** 
- I have been wanting to get faster at md and I figured its best to switch to it. This way, I'll get more github practice and write my documentation in a consistent format.
