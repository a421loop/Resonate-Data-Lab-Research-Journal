# RESEARCH REFLECTIONS 

# Week 11
**Things I am inclined to do**
- I really want to make the questions for an interveiw about the Kashmir Un/making workshop and I really want to create a safe space for people within that workshop
- I really want to read the [mit paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08872) so I can understand it well. I am wondering how to use ai in sound in a way that it doesnt take away from their ability to learn as students in the age of ai
- I really really want to do most of this in the next 2 weeks

## The two concepts we discussed to turn into activities 
### Listening activity

# Week 10 

# 30 July 
### Public Pool/Pond reflection

**Initial Approach and Expectations:**
I thought it would be weird going in but then I was like Idk maybe i am assuming it. And I went anyway, hoping id find you there to collaborate on this.

**Methodological Challenges Encountered:**
When I got there, it felt intrusive to be recording in the pool just by myself. The pool was pretty filled. I didnt think it was safe to do that, so I just left. But it has got me wondering about public places and consent in research contexts. I considered trying it anyway but idk it just felt unsafe and ethically questionable just by myself.

**Adaptive Methodology:**
I ended up recording in maxey pond instead. Even though I couldnt get in the water(its so so dirty there), I feel like I didnt actually do the activity the way it was originally conceived, but what I did instead was trying to record it outside the pond, recording the pond from inside using the zip lock bags and outside perspectives to see if theres a difference in acoustic qualities. It also let me explore other dimensions because I used the camera feature in the voice recording app.

**Findings and Next Steps:**
So i did get something out of it methodologically, but to actually execute the activity as designed, I would probably need to go in with a collaborator for both safety and research ethics reasons. I'll do it before the summer ends but yeah i really felt the research by design principles you talked about - how the constraints become part of the investigation itself.

## Quantative analysis
- its really interesting how much intentionality p17 has in thier life. I want to look more into intentionality of listening and see how that can be incorporated into the YLIS class this fall.
## 28 July
#### Feedback I need to ask for
- which of the three landing pages should I go with?
- what do you think about the sketches on the board? Which of the ideas would benefit the class the most? Gaps and stuff. 
- For retrosound, How much time should i try for before i give up on the personal wifi. Compile everything you did before the meeting.

#### Reflections on Use. 
**Transcription**
- Claude - Sonnet 4: Didnt let me upload an mp3
- Chatgpt - "You cannot use the Whisper model directly here in this app unless OpenAI has added Whisper-based transcription as a built-in feature (currently, it hasn’t for long audios)."
- Whisper - Really good. Ran into a lot of trouble, claude helped. Based on all my errors, asked it to make a [beginner's guide](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/1b28ff16-9294-4e98-8bec-f27cbbd158c2)
##### Activities/Probe ideas
- make collab notebooks that let you do this in drive

# WEEK 9
### 25 Jul: 
- [x] Retrosound App Debugging - MP3 fixes
- [x] Draft Research Journal for week 9 - IN progress
- [x] Try to recorders on a walk
      - [x] Keep it inside your pocket
      - [x] Keep it outside your pocket

- [x] Daily ideas sketching
- [x] Landing page sketches


**Reflections From the Walk: Recording on the Zoom Handy Recorder**
- **Recorder In Hand** : Its really strange walking around with a recorder, its like a statement to people around you that are you witnessing to immortalise their every move.
- **Recorder in Pocket**: It feels like I am intruding on anyone who decides to talk to me. It was hard turning it off before someone talks and then I had to delete the whole recording. But personally, I feel safer having it in my pocket that outside.

**Switch To Markdown** 
- I have been wanting to get faster at md and I figured its best to switch to it. This way, I'll get more github practice and write my documentation in a consistent format.

#### Sketching Day 2: 
1. Somantic Scout(need a better name): I've noticed that when I go on walks with the goal to listen, my default shifts from being anxious about the newness to being curious.

### INTERESTING RESOURCES
- [This](https://www.are.na/sydney-johnson-4a4vmdu4une/sound-walks-and-site-specific-interventions-proposal) reminded me of Sound Walk Club. We should have that. PLEASEEE

## READINGS/LISTENINGS

### [Podcast about Sonic Walks] (https://walkinglab.org/podcast/sound-walks-and-sonic-walks/]

Quotes that stand out 
- "Walking and sound have increasingly been combined in order to explore the sonic ecologies of place. The term soundwalk was first used by Murray Schafer in Vancouver, Canada in the 1970s to describe a method of identifying and describing the soundscapes of a particular environment. Schafer defined a soundscape as the acoustic features that make up a place."
- "Researchers are interested in soundwalks for the ability to immerse walkers in a bodily sense of place."

This made me reflect about my about how I feel so so much in my body when I am on a soundwalk vs a real walk. *I think it has helped me be more curious than anxouus when exploring new places.*

**Reflection on RetroSound Format: Webm Vs MP3**
- I am not sure which one to choose. I was going with webm before first before mp3 wasnt working for me, but then because I found out it has better compression in terms and better quality but it doesnt play on all devices. I think *universal compatibility is a priority* so I need to figure out how to implement MP3. From what i looked up, I will need to use a library (lamejs) that I havent used before. This should be interesting.
