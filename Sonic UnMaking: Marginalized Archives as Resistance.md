# Sonic Un/Making: Marginalized Archives as Resistance

## Core Un/Making Concept
**Unmaking news archives to reclaim agency over marginalized narratives**

**Traditional archives** = institutional control, fixed preservation, visibility as validation. 

**Un/making approach** = community control, fluid recontextualization, strategic invisibility as power. 

## Three Forms of Sonic Un/Making

### 1. **Collage Un/Making** (Queer Identities Method)
- Cut up existing media representations (news, music, social media about Muslims)
- Remix fragments into new sonic collages

**Purpose**: Destabilize dominant narratives by recontextualizing them. 
**Example**: Take Islamophobic news clips → layer with personal stories → create counter-narrative. !!!!What does this look like!!!!

### 2. **Selective Sharing Un/Making** (Hidden Archives)
- Record personal stories in NFC buttons
- Choose who can access (scan to reveal hidden audio)
- **Purpose**: - community-controlled visibility !!!!!does this make any sense!!!
- **Example**: - Button looks like generic art → only community members know to scan for real story

### 3. **Strategic Deletion Un/Making** (Erasure as Agency)
- Participants choose to distort, fragment, or delete their recordings
- Silence becomes active choice, not imposed censorship
- **Purpose**: Protect community while asserting narrative control
- **Example**: Kashmir story gets distorted/encrypted as safety measure, not lost memory --- !!!!needs more editing!!!!

## Installation Mechanics

### Un/Making Stations
- **Deconstruction Station**: Break apart existing media representations
- **Recontextualization Station**: Remix fragments with personal recordings  
- **Opacity Station**: Choose levels of visibility/hiddenness for your archive
- **Deletion Station**: Practice erasure as empowerment, not loss **important concept**

### Participant Choices (The Un/Making Process)
- **Unmake dominant narratives** → cut up mainstream media about your community
- **Make counter-archives** → collage your truth from the fragments
- **Unmake visibility** → choose strategic hiddenness over forced exposure
- **Make new access** → create community-controlled sharing methods

## Research Questions
- How do marginalized communities practice un/making with their own stories?
- When is deletion/distortion/hiddenness a form of resistance rather than loss?
- How does sonic un/making differ from visual un/making?
- What happens when archives are designed for strategic invisibility?

## Key Innovation: **Unmaking as Community Protection**
- Traditional archives: "preserve everything, make it accessible"
- Un/making archives: "preserve selectively, control accessibility, embrace strategic disappearance"
- **Result**: Communities gain power over their own representation

## Assessment Focus
- How often do participants choose **deletion** over preservation?
- What triggers decisions to **hide** vs **share** stories?
- How does **remixing/distorting** change emotional relationship to traumatic content?
- What new forms of **community archives** emerge from un/making practices?

## Expected Outcomes
- **Methodological**: New framework for community-controlled archival practices. 
- **Technological**: Tools that center deletion/hiddenness as features, not bugs.

- **Political**: Demonstration that "disappearing" can be empowerment, not erasure.
- **Theoretical**: Expansion of un/making theory to sonic/archival contexts.
